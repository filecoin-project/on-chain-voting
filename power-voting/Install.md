### 7.Deployment

To deploy the 'dist ' folder generated after building your front-end project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Upload the dist folder to the server**: Upload the `dist` folder to your server. You can use FTP tools, SSH, or other methods to transfer the files to a specific directory on your server.
2. **Configure the Web Server**: Ensure that your web server (such as Nginx, Apache, etc.) is properly configured, and you know where to serve static files from. Add a new site or virtual host in the configuration file and set the document root to point to the uploaded `dist` folder.
3. **Start the Web Server**: Start or restart your web server to apply the new configuration.
4. **Access the Website**: Open your browser and enter your domain name or server IP address. You should be able to see your deployed front-end application.
