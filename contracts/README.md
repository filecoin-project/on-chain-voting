# PowerVoting-Contract

## Overview
The PowerVoting-Contract is a suite of smart contracts designed to facilitate secure and efficient voting and permission management within the Filecoin ecosystem. The contract suite includes the following components:
1. **Vote Contract**: Manages the creation of proposals and the voting process on those proposals, allowing users to participate in decision-making.
2. **FipEditor Contract**: Handles permission management for the FipEditor role. It supports the addition and removal of FipEditors via proposals, ensuring decentralized control.
3. **Oracle Contract**: Supplies external data to support contract interactions. This includes critical updates such as miner IDs and authorization information, enhancing the contracts' ability to interact with real-world data.
4. **Config Contract**: Stores configuration settings for the PowerVoting-Contract suite, including contract addresses and other relevant parameters.
## Deployment and Upgrade Process

### Prerequisites
- Node.js version v18.13.0 or higher.

### Installation
Install the necessary libraries by running the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variable Configuration
1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
2. Configure the corresponding network keys in the `.env` file:
- `PRIVATE_KEY_TESTNET`: The private key of the account for testnet deployment.
- `PRIVATE_KEY_MAINNET`: The private key of the account for mainnet deployment.

### Contract Deployment
1. **Deploy the FipEditor Contract**
   Run the following command to deploy the FipEditor contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_fip.ts --network [network_name]
```
2. **Deploy the Vote Contract**
   Run the following command to deploy the Vote contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_vote.ts --network [network_name]
```
3. **Deploy the Oracle Contract**
   Run the following command to deploy the Oracle contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_oracle.ts --network [network_name]
```
4. **Deploy the Config Contract**
   Run the following command to deploy the Config contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_power_voting_config.ts --network [network_name]
```
> Note:Please check the configuration items of the `init_power_voting_config.ts` file.

   Initialize the Config contract with the addresses of the other contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/init_power_voting_config.ts --network [network_name]
```
5. **Contract Address Storage**
   After the contracts are deployed, the contract addresses will be saved in the `[network_name]_config.json` file in the `scripts` directory. The content format is as follows:
```json
{
  "POWER_VOTING_ORACLE": "",
  "POWER_VOTING_FIP": "",
  "POWER_VOTING_VOTE": "",
  "POWER_VOTING_CONFIG": ""
}
```
**Note:** Ensure to update and securely manage these addresses for future interactions.

### Contract Upgrade
The contracts support upgrade via the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern.
- **Upgrade the FipEditor Contract**
  Run the following command to upgrade the FipEditor contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade_fip.ts --network [network_name]
```
- **Upgrade the Vote Contract**
  Run the following command to upgrade the Vote contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade_vote.ts --network [network_name]
```
- **Upgrade the Oracle Contract**
  Run the following command to upgrade the Oracle contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade_oracle.ts --network [network_name]
```

### Test Cases
You can run the contract's test cases using the following command:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Contract Config
#### Update the maximum snapshot random days  
1. Edit the update_vote_snapshot_random_day.ts file and then configure the value of newSnapshotMaxRandomOffsetDays

2. Run the following command to update snapshotMaxRandomOffsetDays:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/update_vote_snapshot_random_day.ts --network [network_name]
```


### Script Descriptions

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the available scripts in the `scripts` directory:

#### `check.ts`

- **Purpose**: Performs checks on various contract parameters or statuses.

#### `deploy_fip.ts`

- **Purpose**: Deploys the `FipEditor` contract.

#### `deploy_vote.ts`

- **Purpose**: Deploys the `Vote` contract.

#### `deploy_oracle.ts`

- **Purpose**: Deploys the `Oracle` contract.
  
#### ``deploy_power_voting_config.ts`

- **Purpose**: Deploys the `Config` contract and initializes it with the addresses of other contracts.

#### `init_power_voting_config.ts`

- **Purpose**: Initializes the `Config` contract with the addresses of other contracts.

#### `upgrade_fip.ts`

- **Purpose**: Upgrades the `FipEditor` contract to a new implementation using the UUPS pattern.

#### `upgrade_vote.ts`

- **Purpose**: Upgrades the `Vote` contract to a new implementation using the UUPS pattern.

#### `upgrade_oracle.ts`

- **Purpose**: Upgrades the `Oracle` contract to a new implementation using the UUPS pattern.

#### `update_fipetidor_address.ts`

- **Purpose**: Update the FipEditor contract address to the vote contract.

#### `update_vote_snapshot_random_day.ts`

- **Purpose**: Update the maximum snapshot random days in the vote contract.

#### `utils.ts`

- **Purpose**: Contains utility functions that can be used across different scripts, such as address validation or data formatting.

#### `constant.ts`

- **Purpose**: Stores constant values and configurations used throughout the scripts (e.g., contract addresses, network names).

### Notes

- Replace `[network_name]` with the actual network name (e.g., `filecoin_testnet`, `filecoin_mainnet`) when running the deployment and upgrade commands.
- Ensure that the private keys in the `.env` file are kept secure and not exposed.
