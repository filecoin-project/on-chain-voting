2. Get the code of UCAN signature tool.

```
git clone https://github.com/black-domain/ucan-utils.git
```

3. Install the dependencies.

```
go mod tidy
```

4. Build the binary file.

```
go build -o signature .
```

1. run.
```
./signature --aud 0x257c072306d848A6fd2f662Aead6855A7738dFEF --act add --privateKey <your_private_key> --keyType secp256k1

# II.  Authorization for F1、F2 Owner、F3 addresses



## 1. Add authorization



### 1.1 Create a UCAN signature authorized by Filecoin account to Eth account

1、[Follow the process below to create a UCAN signature with act as add](#i-how-to-use-ucan-signature).

<span style="color:red;">Attention: Field **act** should be set to **add**</span>.

The parameters need to be changed as follows:

```
	aud        = "0x257c072306d848A6fd2f662Aead6855A7738dFEF"  //Actual Eth address that requires authorization.
	act        = "add"	  																		 //Input "add" for field "act"
	privateKey = "<your_private_key>"                          //Input private key against Filecoin address. 
	keyType    = "secp256k1"																	 //The encryption algorithm of Filecoin addresses is as follows: addresses starting with f1 use secp256k1, addresses starting with f3 use bls
```



### 1.2 Create a UCAN signature authorized by Eth account to Filecoin account

1. Go to https://vote.storswift.io.

2. Click UCAN Delegates to  authorize.

![img_1.png](img/img_1.png)

3. Select **Filecoin** for UCAN Type. 

4. Enter  **Filecoin address** that requires authorization against field Aud. The Filecoin address is the one that its private key is entered in [1.1 Create a UCAN signature authorized by Filecoin account to Eth account](#11-create-a-ucan-signature-authorized-by-filecoin-account-to-eth-account).

5. Enter **UCAN signature** created in [1.1 Create a UCAN signature authorized by Filecoin account to Eth account](#11-create-a-ucan-signature-authorized-by-filecoin-account-to-eth-account)   against filed Proof.

### 1.3 Authorization

1. After filling in the parameters, click **Authorize** to sign the message and send it on chain, then authorized successfully.



## 2. Cancel authorization



### 2.1 Create a UCAN signature deauthorized by Filecoin account to Eth account

<span style="color:red;">Attention:field act  should be set to del.</span>

1、[Follow the process below to create a UCAN signature with act as del.](#i-how-to-use-ucan-signature)

The parameters need to be changed as follows:

```
	aud        = "0x257c072306d848A6fd2f662Aead6855A7738dFEF"  //Eth address that requires authorization
	act        = "del"	  																		 //Input "del" for field "act"
	privateKey = "<your_private_key>"                          //Input the private key against Filecoin address
	keyType    = "secp256k1"																	 //The encryption algorithm of Filecoin addresses is as follows: addresses starting with f1 use secp256k1, addresses starting with f3 use bls
```



### 2.2 Create a UCAN signature deauthorized by Eth account to Filecoin account

**Prerequisite: Eth account has UCAN authorization already**。

1. Go to https://vote.storswift.io.

2. Click UCAN Delegates to  cancel authorization.  The website will monitor whether the Eth account has UCAN authorization or not. The action  will cancel the authorization if it does.

![img_1.png](img/img_1.png)

3. Iss & Aud are auto filled, you only need to enter UCAN created in [2.1 Create a UCAN signature deauthorized by Filecoin account to Eth account](#21-create-a-ucan-signature-deauthorized-by-filecoin-account-to-eth-account) against field Proof.

### 1.4 Upload the UCAN signature to Github repository (authorized by ETH address to Github handle) 

1. Command.

```
  curl -L \
  -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.Github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \

![img_11.png](img/img_11.png)



## 2. Deauthorization



### 2.1 Create a UCAN signature deauthorized by Eth account to Github handle

1. Go to https://vote.storswift.io.

2. Click UCAN Delegates to  authorize.

![img_1.png](img/img_1.png)

3. After authorized successfully for Developers, the authorized Github handle will be displayed when entering authorization page. No need to enter parameters, click on **Sign** and you will get UCAN signature for cancelling authorization. 

![img_12.png](img/img_12.png)

![img_13.png](img/img_13.png)



### 2.2  Upload the UCAN signature to Github repository (deauthorized by ETH address to Github handle) 

1. Create a new public repository on Github, refer to [1.2 Create an initialized public repository on Github](#12-create-an-initialized-public-repository-on-github) if necessary.

2. Create a Token used to upload the UCAN signature to repository, refer to [1.3 Create a Token used to upload the UCAN signature to the repository](#13-create-a-token-used-to-upload-ucan-signature-to-the-repository) if necessary.

3. Upload  the UCAN signature to Github repository (deauthorized by ETH account to Github)  , UCAN signature is generated from [2.1 Create a UCAN signature deauthorized by Eth account to Github account](#21-create-a-ucan-signature-deauthorized-by-filecoin-account-to-eth-account),
   [1.4 Upload the UCAN signature to Github repository (authorized by ETH address to Github handle) ](#14-upload-the-ucan-signature-to-github-repository-authorized-by-eth-address-to-github-handle-).

![img_14.png](img/img_14.png)



### 2.4 Delete the Github repository that saves UCAN signature

1.  After deauthorization, the Eth account can still obtain the authorized UCAN signature in the repo through the URL and authorize it again. To avoid the case mentioned before,  there is need to  delete the repository that saves authorized&deauthorized UCAN signature. 

2. Find the **settings** for repository that saves UCAN signature.

![img_15.png](img/img_15.png)

3. Select **Delete this repository** at the bottom of the page.
